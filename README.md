This is a chrome extension using which you can keep all you leads at one place.
You can manually add the lead by writing it on input field & then click on 'SAVE INPUT' button.
If you want to save a tab then just simply click on 'SAVE TAB' button.
If you want to delete all the leads, click on 'DELETE ALL' button

I have used chrome API to get the url of current active tab. 
'DELETE ALL' button will work on double clicking on it.
Btw, this is another project learnt from scrimba.
